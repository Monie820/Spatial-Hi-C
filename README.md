# Spatial Hi-C
Spatial Hi-C method provides a valuable technology to study spatial chromatin structures and their 3D genome regulation in complex tissues.

## Abstract
The 3D chromatin architecture is crucial for understanding gene regulatory programs in the development and disease. However, the direct mapping genome-wide 3D chromatin structures while retaining spatial information in tissues is still lacking. Here, we develop a spatial Hi-C method to resolve chromatin architecture profiling within tissues at cellular resolution. The spatial Hi-C can obviously distinguish different neuronal and non-neuronal cells in mammalian brains. Furthermore, according to spatial Hi-C during the mouse brain development, we observe an increased trend of short/long chromatin interaction ratio along the inside-to-outside radial direction on coronal brain sections, which is associated with neuronal maturity. Finally, spatial Hi-C unveiled cerebellar granular cell subtypes with distinguished 3D chromatin structures, presenting specific spatial lobule locations in the adult mouse cerebellum. In all, our spatial Hi-C method provides a valuable technology to study spatial chromatin structures and their 3D genome regulation in complex tissues.
